# Tips for this week

Comment on the personality type identified in the questionnaire.  Discuss the role you hope to play in the team.

My personality type is a Diplomat and Facilatator. The role I hope to play in the team is to support all the team members when they need help and to be reliable team member throughout the project.

In this first session, we also discussed about the client/project requirements and discussed about the questions we wanted to ask in the client meeting that will happen on Week 2.
